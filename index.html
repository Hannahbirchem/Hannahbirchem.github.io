<h2> Studying Social Science at Oregon State - Cascades, Bend Oregon </h2>

<div class="project"> 
	<h3> Bio </h3>
	<p> I am an Oregonian. I was born in Bend and have lived here all my life. I have proudly adopted the "Bendite" title and all that it entails- hiking, running, snowboarding, and driving a Subaru. I am collage student at Oregon State - Cascades. I am studying social sciences as a stepping-stone in order to achieve my career goal. I have a track record of a lot of volunteer work and love it. I am very involved in my church and organizing events. I aspire to be a resource developer and raise money for nonprofit organizations </p>
