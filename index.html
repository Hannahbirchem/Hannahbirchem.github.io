<p style="font-style:cambria;font-size:1em;"> I just recently drove my brothers motorcycle and now feel the need to buy my own.

<h2 style="color:gray;font-family;cambria;font-stretch:7em;">Goals for the class:</h2>
<p style="font-style:cambria;font-size:1em;"> My goals for this class are interesting. I do not know what to expect and when I registered for this it was only because my advisor told me I needed this class. With that said, I like to be the best at everything. My goal for this class is to be the best programer EVER.</p>
